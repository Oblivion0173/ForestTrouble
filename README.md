This is a 2D sidescrolling combat platformer created using Godot 4. It features a fully controllable main character, 2 basic enemies, a boss room, and original sprites and animations for all of them. A few complex mechanisms are implemented, such as a parry system for the bosses, and enemy specific attacks.
